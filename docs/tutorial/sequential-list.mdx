## Introduction

For most people, sequential lists (or SL) is an easier way to get started with gcsim. Unlike it's older cousin APL, there is no priorities involved. Using sequntial list is akin to calculating using a spreadsheet, without the complexity of managing buffs/debuffs as that is taken care by the gcsim backend automatically.

By default, the simulator will assume that you are running the simulation in APL mode. To activate SL mode, you will need the following line in your config (usually near the top):

```
option iteration=1000 duration=90 mode=sl;
```

Note that the `iteration` and `duration` options should be changed to fit your needs.

### Active character and targets

You will need to set the starting active character as well as the enemy targets. The commands have the following structure:

```
active <character name>;
target lvl=<enemy lvl> resist=<resistane value in decimals>
```

Make sure the `<character name>` is a character actually on the team you have selected. Following our example above, this could be one of `ganyu` `diona` `venti` or `mona` depending on whoever you want to be the initial active character

The `target` command tells gcsim what stats to use for the target you wish to calculate team dps against. `lvl` is the target lvl and should be between 1 to 100. `resist` sets the resistance of the target. For example `resist=0.1` will set every resistance of the target to 10%. If you need to set specific resistances instead (such as higher physical resistance), you can use the following setting:

`target lvl=100 pyro=0.1 dendro=0.1 hydro=0.1 electro=0.1 geo=0.1 anemo=0.1 cryo=.1 physical=.3;`

In this example above, the physical resistance is set to 30%.

If you wish to calculate vs multiple targets, simply duplicate the target line as many times as you wish. For example:

```
active ganyu;
target lvl=100 resist=0.1;
target lvl=100 resist=0.1;
target lvl=100 resist=0.1;
```

This would set 3 targets, each at level 100 with 10% resistance across.

### Character actions

Character actions follows a very simple pattern. They are best understood by example.

**Example 1: Ganyu uses burst followed by skill**

```
ganyu burst,skill;
```

**Example 2: Hutao N2CJ**

```
hutao attack:2,charge,jump;
```
