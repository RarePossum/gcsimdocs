# Getting Started

To get started, simply head over to our website at [https://gcsim.app](https://gcsim.app). As of February 19, 2022, we are transition fully into this new web application and will no longer be offering the desktop application (although older version still available for download).

## Advanced users

For advanced users, the command line tool is still available and can be built directly from source. The command line tool offers performance boost over the web application as it is not subject to limitations in the browser. The git repo is located [here](https://github.com/genshinsim/gcsim). You will need to have go installed. Use the following command to run the tool:

```shell
cd cmd/gcsim
go run .
```
